* Atmel Studio AVR-xx_DFP version 1.0.21 or later <!-- Not public DFP-->
## Hardware Used

* [AVR128Dxx Curiosity Nano](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/AVR128Dxx) <!-- Not the correct link, fix when curiosity nano page exists-->

## Setup

* Connect the hardware together as seen in the schematic of the [application note](https://microchip.com/DSxxxxxxxxxx) <!--fill in DS number once it has been assigned-->

## Operation
* Connect the AVR128Dx Curiosity Nano to a computer using a USB cable
* Download the zip file or clone the example to get the source code
* Open the .atsln file with Atmel Studio
* Press *Start Without Debugging* (CTRL+ALT+F5) to run the application

## Conclusion
After going through this example, you should have a better understanding of how to set up the OPAMP peripheral to amplify weak signals from sensors into detectable signals for the MCU.
