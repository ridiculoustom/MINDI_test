# Getting started with Mindi(R) simulation and the AVR Dx
This is how you get going in n easy steps
## Download Mindi
Download and install the applicaiton from here:

## Model
Mindi needs a model for the part. Find it.

## Setup

* Connect the hardware together as seen in the schematic of the [application note](https://microchip.com/DSxxxxxxxxxx) <!--fill in DS number once it has been assigned-->

## Operation
* Connect the AVR128Dx Curiosity Nano to a computer using a USB cable
* Download the zip file or clone the example to get the source code
* Open the .atsln file with Atmel Studio
* Press *Start Without Debugging* (CTRL+ALT+F5) to run the application

## Conclusion
After going through this example, you should have a better understanding of how to set up the OPAMP peripheral to amplify weak signals from sensors into detectable signals for the MCU.
